Python Learning Progress

Day 1 (July 18th)
Just hacked out some code. It looks terrible, but it's my brand of terrible so I'm okay with that. It's too hot to care about coding conventions being followed. Also, I have no idea what the Python conventions are.

Anyways, I just wrote some basic classes that I think will be used. I haven't done too much upfront planning as I'm mostly concerned with learning Python. We'll see how this goes. Also, knowing me, we'll see how long I keep this up. Vegas odds the smart money on under 4 days, so let's see if I can beat that.
