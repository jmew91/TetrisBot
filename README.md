# TetrisBot

Trying to (re)learn Python. I've only really used Python once and that was about 8 years ago. I haven't really touched it since so I figure it'd be fun to revisit. Making a Tetris bot was how I first learned it, so I thought it'd be cool to do the same approach. There are also some new things I want to build on what I did way back then, so I think this would be a fun side project.
